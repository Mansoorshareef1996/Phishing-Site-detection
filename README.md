# Phishing Site detection
Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to memorize the fragile information such as login accreditation or account information by sending as a genuine substance or person in mail or other communication channels. It is a significant security threat to the Internet and a complex problem involving many factors and criteria. It is important for us to identify the phishing websites using different parameters that the attacker can use. 

This mode of attack is used by the attacker as it is easy for them to create a website that resembles a legitimate one rather than breaking into someoneâ€™s computer to get their important information. We would use the data mining techniques in the following spotlight topic to solve this problem of identifying if the website is a legitimate one or a phishing website. The dataset is taken from the Kaggle where the dataset contains the features for the different parameters that are used to identify if a website is legitimate or not. We load the data and Identify the inputs and the outputs attribute . We would divide the data into test and train data where the test data would provide the trained data . The next step is to train the classifier and make predictions. We also use the decision tree to identify the phishing website.
